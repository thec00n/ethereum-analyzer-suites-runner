## Introduction

This repo aims to be a collection of benchmarks suites for evaluating the precision of EVM code analysis tools.

If you just want to see the reports created as a result of running the various analyzers over the benchmark suites, you can find that [here](https://ethereumanalysisbenchmarks.github.io/).

It started out as is a fork of Suhabe Bugara's excellent benchmark
suite, and [this
link](https://diligence.consensys.net/evm-analyzer-benchmark-suite)
shows the results of running some tools on this benchmarks as of May
2018.

Another benchmark we add as a git submodule is Trail of Bits [(Not So) Smart Contracts](https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts).

Reports from running `runner/run.py` and `runner/report.py` are [here](https://SmartContractSecurity.github.io/).

## Cloning

Since there is a git submodule in this repository clone using the `--recurse-submodules` option. For example:

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner.git
```

### Forgot to `--recurse-submodules` on clone?

_Only_ If you forget the `--recurse-submodules` on the `git clone` do the following:

```console
$ git submodule init
Submodule 'benchmarks/Suhabe' (https://github.com/ConsenSys/evm-analyzer-benchmark-suite.git) registered for path 'benchmarks/Suhabe'
Submodule 'benchmarks/nssc' (https://github.com/trailofbits/not-so-smart-contracts.git) registered for path 'benchmarks/nssc'
$ git submodule update
Cloning into '/src/external-vcs/github/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/benchmarks/Suhabe'...
Cloning into '/src/external-vcs/github/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/nchmarks/nssc'...
...
```

## Benchmarks have changed?

If benchmarks change and you want to pull in the new benchmark code, use `git submodule update`.

## Project setup

The reports programs are written in Python 3.6 or better. To install dependent Python packages, run:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Analysers setup
Analysers are not part of project dependencies and they should be installed manually. The reason for this was to make setup not dependent on analysers failures (there might be some) and to make it possible for user to select specific analysers to benchmark, instead of installing all of them.

Below, you will find a list of supported analysers with installation instructions and known bugs that prevents installation or makes analyser unworkable.

### [Mythril](https://github.com/ConsenSys/mythril)
Available in PyPi
```console
$ pip install mythril
```

### [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore)
Available in PyPi
```console
$ pip install manticore
```

Known bugs:
- `ValueError: not allowed to raise maximum limit`
  * Description: Latest version in PyPi - `0.2.0` fails during analyser execution
  * Workaround: Source code in master branch already contains fix. Thus, while the new version for PyPi is not released manticore must be installed manually:
  ```console
  $ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore.git
  $ cd manticore/
  $ pip install .
  ```

- Installation fails on MacOS
  * Description: https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/issues/1075
  * Workaround: n/a. On some systems with MacOS it was possible to successfully install it, therefore try to install at firsts.

## About Python Code to Run Benchmarks and Create Reports

We assme the benchmark suite repositories is set up using in git via the `--recurse-submodules` switch described above. With this in place, the two Python programs are run in sequence to:

* run an analyzer over a benchmark suite, and
* generate HTML reports for a benchmark suite that we have gathered data for in the previous step

### [runner/run.py](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/blob/master/runner/run.py)
Executes specified benchmark suite.
Input arguments:
- `-s`, `--suite`       Benchmark suite name. Default `Suhabe`. Currently supported: `Suhabe`, `nssc`
- `-a`, `--analyser`    Analyser to benchmark. If not set all supported analysers will be benchmarked.
                        Currently supported: `Mythril`, `Manticore`, `Oyente`
- `-v`, `--verbose`     More verbose output; use twice for the most verbose output
- `-t`, `--timeout`     Maximum time allowed on any single benchmark. Default 7 seconds
- `--files`             Print list of files in benchmark and exit

**Description:**
The first program `runner/run.py` takes a number of command-line
arguments; one of them is the name of a benchmark suite. From that it
reads two YAML configuration files for the benchmark. The first YAML
file has information about the benchmark suite: the names of the files
in the benchmarks, whether the benchmark is supposed to succeed or
fail with a vulnerability, and possibly other information. An example
of such a YAML file is
[benchconf/Suhabe.yaml](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/blob/master/benchconf/Suhabe.yaml). The
other YAML input configuration file is specific to the analyzer. For
Mythril on the Suhabe benchmark, it is called
[benchconf/Suhabe-Mythril.yaml](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/blob/master/benchconf/Suhabe-Mythril.yaml)

For each new Benchmark suite, these two YAML files will need to
exist. The second one you can start out with an empty file.

The output is a YAML file which is stored in the folder
[`benchdata`](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/tree/master/benchdata)
with a subfolder under that with the name of the benchmark. For
example the output of `run.py` for the Suhabe benchmark suite will be a
file called `benchdata/Suhabe/Mythril.yaml`.

### [runner/report.py](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/ethereum-analyzers-suites-runner/blob/master/runner/report.py)
Takes the aforementioned data YAML files and creates a HTML report from that.
Input arguments:
- `-s`, `--suite`       Benchmark suite name. Default `Suhabe`,


Here is an example of complete report generation using Mythril on the Suhabe benchmark giving Mythril 5 minutes maximum to analyze a single benchmark:

```console
$ python runner/run.py --timeout 300 --suite Suhabe --analyser Mythril
$ python runner/report.py --suite Suhabe
```

## Adding additional analyser to benchmark
Source code related to analysers is located in `runner/analysers/` module. In order to add support of a new analyser:
* Implement new class inherited from `BaseAnalyser`
* New class must be **imported** in `analyser/__init__.py`
* Create configuration files with expected output in `benchconf/`
Please check existing analysers as an example.
